OULibraries.centos7
=========

Base CentOS7 role for OULib.

Requirements
------------

A target system running CentOS7x.

Role Variables
--------------
* Disable IPv6

In some instances we want to enable or disable IPv6. To do this we need to add the following boolean variable to our myvars.yml:

  centos7_ipv6_disable: true

True will disable IPv6 and False will not change the CentOS default and keep iPv6 enabled.

Please note this is not an idempotent config change. If IPv6 is disabled it will need to be manually enabled.


* centos7_swap optionally creates and enables a swapfile of the specified path and size. The example below would give you a 4GiB swap at /swapfile0
```
centos7_swap:
  file_path: /swapfile0
  file_size: 4194304
```

vpshere tagged tasks expect server_name, server_ip, and broker_ip.
* servername is the value for the hostname. Defaults to current FQDN.
* server_ip sets the NIC address (Gateway, Netmask, and DNS should already be configured in your base image). Defaults to current address. We set this because we set the IP after firing up a base box on a known addres.
* centos7_iptables contains a list of firewall exceptions for vmware and bare metal installs.  If you leave this empty, say goodby to ssh access. example below

```
centos7_iptables:
  - rule_name: Some SSH Broker
    source_ip: 192.168.0.2/32
    tcp_port: 22
  - rule_name: HTTP
    source_ip: 0.0.0.0
    tcp_port: 139
  - rule_name: HTTPS
    source_ip: 0.0.0.0
    tcp_port: 443
```

Dependencies
------------

Written with lastpass-cli in mind. Role information forthcoming

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: username.rolename, x: 42 }
